EU GDP, meanwhile, is expected to have shrunk 6.4%, according to Eurostat.\n",

    "\"Today's figures show that the economy has experienced a serious shock as a result of the pandemic, which has been felt by countries around the world,\" UK finance minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement. \"While there are some positive signs of the economy's resilience over the winter, we know that the current lockdown continues to have a significant impact on many people and businesses.\"\n",
    "The new national lockdown in the United Kingdom, imposed on January 5, is expected to hit the economy hard in the first quarter of 2021, reversing the return to growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n",
